.SH NAME
getver \- crawls a given URL and tries to find the version number
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B getver URL to extract version information from
.SH DESCRIPTION
getver will crawl the given URL, to a specified depth and use various
heuristics to extract the most likely version number.  .sp If no version number
is found, error code 2 is returned. If something else should fail, error code 1
is returned.  .sp For some projects, the first returned version number may not
be what you want (python.org returns the latest version number for Python 3 and
then the latest version number for Python 2, for example). If this is the case,
use the -u flag together with a number that selects the desired match.
.sp
getver is multithreaded.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.B getver
Exits with error code 1 and an example for how to use the utility.
.sp
.B getver URL
Tries to find the most likely version number from the given URL.
.sp
.B getver -u 1 python.org
Returns the first result from python.org, which is the version number for
Python 3.
.sp
.B getver -u 2 python.org
Returns the second result from python.org, which is the version number for
Python 2.
.sp
.B getver -d 2 -u 1 --sort grails.org
Crawls grails.org with a depth of 2, sorts the results in descending order and
returns the first result.  Sorting may be necessary when crawling with a
depth > 1, to retrieve the version number from the same version number placement.
.PP
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-u use a specific result, indexed from 1
.TP
.B \-n retrieve more than one result (the default is 1). Use together with
--number to number the results.
.TP
.B \-d crawl the given URL with the given depth (the default is 1)
.TP
.B \-f include filenames with version numbers when gathering results
.TP
.B \-t specify a timeout per request, in milliseconds (the default is 10000)
When crawling with a depth > 1, a lower timeout value may yield results faster.
.TP
.B \-\-nostrip don't strip away letters from potential version numbers, but
keep them as part of the result.
.TP
.B \-\-sort sort the results, indescending order. The default sort is usually
more suitable, but not stable.  This sort is stable, but the result you want
may appear much longer down on the list of results.
.TP
.B \-\-help displays brief usage information
.TP
.B \-\-version application name and version
.TP
.PP
.SH "WHY"
.sp
Aims to make it easy to find out if a project has released a new version.
